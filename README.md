# PlaneNode
This repository contains everything you need to set up a PlaneNode.  It is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 0W, 3B+, and 4B.



It has three parts:

## AirRun ![Airrun CI-CD](https://github.com/Joseph-Melberg/PlaneNode/workflows/Airrun%20CI-CD/badge.svg)

The heart of this operation is the dump1090 executable.  It takes info from the radio usb stick and presents this information for anyone who will listen.

## AirConnect ![Airconnect CI-CD](https://github.com/Joseph-Melberg/PlaneNode/workflows/Airconnect%20CI-CD/badge.svg)

This serves to present the plane information to my server, www.centurionx.net.

## AirHeart ![Airrun CI-CD](https://github.com/Joseph-Melberg/PlaneNode/workflows/Airrun%20CI-CD/badge.svg)

This serves to give me an idea of the state of the node.
